Choose your focus wisely. Delivering complete functionality with high standard over full functionality with low quality is preferred.

# Installation
On first installation run maven goal : "mvn spring-boot:run -Pprod"
to install npm and node for the first time.
"mvn spring-boot:run" afterward to run.

# Miscellaneous
- CSRFs (Cross site request forgery) are typically conducted using malicious social engineering, such as an email or link that tricks the victim into sending a forged request to a server. As the unsuspecting user is authenticated by their application at the time of the attack, itâ€™s impossible to distinguish a legitimate request from a forged one.
