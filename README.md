# Miscellaneous
- CSRFs (Cross site request forgery) are typically conducted using malicious social engineering, such as an email or link that tricks the victim into sending a forged request to a server. As the unsuspecting user is authenticated by their application at the time of the attack, itâ€™s impossible to distinguish a legitimate request from a forged one.
